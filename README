 What is guacamole-auth-shibble?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-shibble is a Java library for use with the Guacamole web
application which uses Shibboleth with a MySQL database for looking up
local passwords. It is intended for use with the Shibble python web app.

The remote_user header is used as field for identifying users based on their
Shibboleth authentication. This value is then used as a look up for a
password from the given database.

Remote desktop configuration settings are found from the given XML file,
and passed through to Guacamole. Shibboleth username (in our case, we use
the email address) and password resolved from the database are then added
to the RDP configuration settings and a seamless login should occur.

This code is targeting Guacamole v0.9.9

 Compiling and installing guacamole-auth-shibble
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-shibble is built using Maven. Building guacamole-auth-shibble
compiles all classes and packages them into a redistributable .jar file. This
.jar file can be installed in the library directory configured in
guacamole.properties such that the authentication provider is available.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

    If this process fails, check the build errors, and verify that the
    contents of your settings.xml file is correct.

2) Extract the .tar.gz file now present in the target/ directory, and
   place the .jar files in the extracted lib/ subdirectory in the library
   directory specified in guacamole.properties.

    You will likely need to do this as root.

    If you do not have a library directory configured in your
    guacamole.properties, you will need to specify one. The directory
    is specified using the "lib-directory" property.

3) Write a shibble-config.xml file containing all desired connections

    The guacamole-auth-shibble authentication provided is configured by a
    static XML file which lists all available connections.

    The file consists of a single <configs> tag which contains any number of
    <config> tags, each having a name and protocol. These <config> tags
    correspond to connections.

    Each <config> can contain any number of <param> tags which correspond to
    the parameters of the protocol chosen. Each <param> tag has a name and
    value, where the name is defined by the documentation of the protocol
    being used.

    For example, to define a single RDP connection to your RDP server with
    the hostname "my-rdp-server-hostname", you could write:

    <configs>
      <config name="my-rdp-server" protocol="rdp">
        <param name="hostname" value="my-rdp-server-hostname" />
        <param name="port" value="3389" />
      </config>
    </configs>

    When completed, this file should be placed in a common location such
    that it can be referenced from guacamole.properties, like
    /etc/guacamole/shibble-config.xml.

4) Configure guacamole.properties

    An additional property is required by guacamole-auth-shibble which defines
    where the configuration file is found. It must be added to your
    guacamole.properties:

    # Configuration for Shibble Auth
    shibble-config: /etc/guacamole/shibble-config.xml

5) Restart Tomcat

    The guacamole.properties file as well as any authentication provider .jar
    files are only read when Tomcat starts. This goes for any other servlet
    container as well.

    You must restart Tomcat before any of the above changes can take effect.
